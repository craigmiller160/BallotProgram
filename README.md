# BallotProgram
===============
My first fully built program, an electronic election ballot creation program
Version 6.0
===============
This program was inspired by my work in electoral politics. It provides a basic user interface to perform three main functions:

1) Create and edit the content of an election ballot. The elected offices on that ballot, the candidates running for those offices, and the ballot questions.
2) Save the ballot configuration file for future access (NOTE: the save directory is still inside the project directory).
3) Run the ballot configuration file to generate an electronic ballot where voters can cast their votes for the various positions. Allow the selection of one or more than one candidate based on the nature of the office (eg, County Freeholder, Vote for Two).

Future Ideas:
1) Move save directory out of program directory, configure for default directory on disk.
2) Save and track votes made when running the Ballot itself.
